//MODULE ASSIGNMENT 2 - LEVEL 1

1. 

1. What is a function literal?

	A function literal is an expresseion that defines an unamed function.

	since a function realy is a object in javascript it can be stored as a variable like this.

	var test = function (a, b) {
	return a * b;
	};

	"test" can be used unside an other function like this:

	function newfunc(){
	
		var result;
		result = test(40,60);
		console.log(result);
	
	}




2. What is the constructor?


	A constructor is like recipefor how you create objects with similar features. In Javascript the constructors is mostly used as Constructor functions like this:
	function warrior(strengh, height, gender){
			this.strengh=strengh;
			this.height = height;
			this.gender = gender;
	}
	This keyword means in a way the object that "owns" the code, and it will become the new Object when creating the new Object:
	var Viking = new Viking(100,100,"female");





3. What does the return statement do?


	The return statment will stop the functions execution and return a value back.
		like this:

		function test(){
			return 5;
		}

	Will return 5 from that function.




4. What will be written to the console from this function:

		
function myFunction(){
			  
return console.log('inside my function');
  //inside my function will be written to the console		  
console.log('My name is Andy');
		   //My name is Andy will be undefined since the function returned before this part was exxecuted.
}
		
myFunction();







5. Briefly describe scope in JavaScript.

  
	There are different types of scope in java. Global Scope and function scope. 
	Global scope is the place if you create variables outside any functions or prior to any JavaScript. 
	The Global variable can be accessed by all the functions that you create in the global scope.
	The functional scope on the other hand is variables that you create inside a function and those can only be accessed inside that function and not from other function or outside the function.
	One little thing that is important to remember when writing variables in a function is to specify the variable with "var". 
	If not, the interpreter/or browser will put the variable in the global scope, and it can be accessed by "everybody". 
	This can in turn mess up the code.  Another way is to use the "use strict"; mode.  If you don’t declare a variable inside a function with the "use strict" mode. The Compiler will trow an error.
